**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Julius Ramirez**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [X] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] The user is able to switch between memorizing pictures and colors
- [x] The user is able to add up to eight buttons total
- [x] The user is able to remove buttons to a minimum of 4 buttons total

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   One challenge that I encountered was reading and understanding the html code that was given to me. I was overwhelmed by the code because I primarily program in Java and Python. The syntax and style of HTML was different and
   I had never used Glitch before to program. Additionally I had not programmed in HTML in 6 years. After implementing the code that was given through the instructions, I spent time looking at what each function did individually
   so that I could understand how the program worked as a whole and also so I could understand how to create and utilize my own classes and functions. I was quickly able to pick up the syntax of HTML, however there were
   some tasks I didn't know how to do, such as generating a random number and using the ceiling function. I would search how to do these tasks and through those online resources I was able to implement most of the designs
   I had hoped on adding. 
   Another challenge I encountered was determining where to start with the project. I knew that I wanted to add more features to the game, however I was unsure of what features to add and how to add them. I wrote down features
   that came to mind and kept in mind which features were simpler or more complicated to implement. I started with the simple features and from there, I decomposed the problem so that I could take small steps that would lead me 
   towards the bigger overall feature. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   One big question I have about web development is in regards to how websites operate online. For example, how does a website make a connection to a server and how does a website ensure that
   it is safe and secure. In regards to design, I wonder how I could change my webpage in order to be more aesthetically pleasing. My website is not as visually engaging as I would like it to be and I wonder what else I could do 
   beyond changing the color scheme and font of the site. I am also curious on how HTML projects differ from projects in other languages such as Java and Python, what is it like to work in a team on an web development project and what 
   type of projects are typically created for web development. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would research more on how to add sounds into the memory game. My plan was to add images and sound in a seperate mode called picture mode
   and while I was able to succesfully add pictures into the game, I was unable to succesfully implement sound into my game. I was able to add sound that would play when the
   image was clicked, however I could not determine how to make the sound end after several seconds. Another change I would make is to have the buttons and images appear in a specific arrangement depending on how large
   the tab is. In other words, the arrangement of buttons would be organized and orderly. I would also like to implement some dynamic features to the website. For example when the game is playing I would
   dim the background and text so the colors could stand out more, when the mode is changed from picture mode to tile mode, the buttons would be animated and move to the right off of the screen in order to allow the 
   new buttons to be center on the screen. I would also add a different noise that plays when the player selects the wrong button so it is more obvious that they selected the wrong button, along with three red X's that
   appear depending on how many incorrect guesses the user makes.
